# bih/spotify-ruby

A modern, opinionated and *unofficial* Ruby SDK for the [Spotify Web API][spotify-web-api] to help developers all over the world build amazing music things with Spotify.

This is a work in progress. **Currently in pre-alpha.**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bih/spotify-ruby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bih/spotify-ruby)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spotify-ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install spotify-ruby

## Usage

Configure with your client credentials and redirect URL. Get it [for free here][spotify-developer-dashboard].

```ruby
@auth = Spotify::Auth.new({
  client_id: ENV["SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID"],
  client_secret: ENV["SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET"],
  redirect_uri: ENV["SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI"]
})
```

You'll need to redirect your users to Spotify for authentication. This might help:
```ruby
puts @auth.authorize_url # => https://accounts.spotify.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=...
```

TODO: Write more detailed usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
