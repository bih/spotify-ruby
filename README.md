## Introduction

Hey! I'm a Developer Advocate at [Spotify], and I wrote this Ruby SDK to explore how to build a SDK that is TADA:

- **🧒 Thoughtfully inclusive for beginners.** Everything we do should think about beginners from the beginning. Everything. That includes documentation, tooling, and the feedback we give. Designing for beginners is designing for longevity.

- **☁️ Agnostic to minor changes.** APIs change all the time. We should be opinionated enough that our software should break with major changes, but flexible enough to work perfectly fine with major changes. We only depend on critical data, such as IDs.

- **🌈 Delightful for developers.** Writing the SDK and using the SDK should be equally delightful. Granted, this is a challenging goal; but with solid information architecture, well-crafted opinions, clear and helpful error messages, and software that doesn't get in your way - we will create quite lovely software.

- **✨ A maintained production-level.** It doesn't take experts to write production-level code; all it takes is considerate guidance from the community. We should write software expecting it to be used in the next 5 years. Great tests help us & others understand and trust what we intended.

*Disclaimer: This SDK is NOT owned or supported by Spotify. It remains a personal project of mine. If you are a commercial partner of Spotify and wish to use this SDK, be aware you are using it at your own risk.*

## Install

### With Bundler

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "spotify-ruby"
```

And then execute in your Terminal:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Finally you can include the SDK via `Bundler.require`:

```ruby
require "bundler"
Bundler.require
```

### Manual Install

Or, you can install manually by executing this in your Terminal:

```bash
$ gem install spotify-ruby
```

Then you can include the SDK in your Ruby project:

```ruby
require "spotify-ruby"
```

## Configuration

You'll firstly need to register your client ID on [developer.spotify.com]. You should receive a Client ID and Client Secret which we'll need to continue.

### Your App Credentials

As mentioned above, you'll need to register your client ID. We recommend you that you use a different set of client IDs for development and production. We'll need to use those credentials in order to use any of Spotify's APIs.

To define your app credentials, you'll need to create an instance of `Spotify::Accounts`:

```ruby
@accounts = Spotify::Accounts.new
@accounts.client_id = ENV["SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID"]
@accounts.client_secret = ENV["SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET"]
@accounts.redirect_uri = ENV["SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI"]
```

### Authorization

In order to use Spotify's APIs on a user's behalf, you'll need to use the Spotify [Accounts API] to redirect them to `https://accounts.spotify.com`. They will then need to explicitly approve your application and what data you're asking for (technically referred to as authorization scopes).

**Recommended for production:** To request specific data, read our [Authorization Scopes] reference, and then execute:

```ruby
@accounts.authorize_url({
  scope: "user-read-private user-read-email user-top-read"
}) # => "https://accounts.spotify.com/oauth/authorize?..."
```

**Recommended for exploration / local development:** Or, to request all data, you can execute:

```ruby
@accounts.authorize_url # => "https://accounts.spotify.com/oauth/authorize?..."
```

### Creating a Session

Each session lasts 60 minutes. New sessions can be generated when you have a valid `refresh_token` (they become invalid [if a user revokes your application](https://support.spotify.com/uk/account_payment_help/privacy/revoke-access-from-3rd-party-app/)).

After a user has authorized your application, they'll be sent to your `redirect_uri` defined in [Your App Credentials](#your-app-credentials) with a `code` parameter. We can use this to create a `Spotify::Session`:

```ruby
@session = @accounts.exchange_for_session(params[:code])
```

We can check when the session expires, and when we should refresh:

```ruby
@session.expires_at # => 2018-07-08 22:40:15 +0200

if @session.expired?
  @session.refresh!
end
```

You'll then be able to use `@session` in the `Spotify::SDK` object. See the [Using the SDK](#using-the-sdk) section below.

### Recreating a Session

We don't want to send the user to `https://accounts.spotify.com/...` every time they want to use your application. For this case, we'll need to export the `refresh_token` and persist it somewhere:

```ruby
@session.refresh_token # => "BQASNDMelPsTdJMNMZfWdbxsuuM1FiBxvVzasqWkwYtgpjXJO60Gm51R0LO_-3Q5MfzCU0xIrbIFs7ZlMQrVJeRwN1_Ffa3sIJn_KW6LO8vA44fYc85oz48TuBuZsT2gzr4L"
```

Then you can repeatedly create a session with just a refresh token and running `refresh!`:

```ruby
@session = Spotify::Session.from_refresh_token(@accounts, "refresh_token here")
@session.expired? # => true
@session.refresh!
@session.expired? # => false
```

## Using the SDK

To create an instance of the Spotify SDK, you'll need the `@session` from above and pass it to `Spotify::SDK` as follows:

```ruby
@session = Spotify::Session.from_refresh_token(@accounts, "refresh_token here")
@session.refresh!

@sdk = Spotify::SDK.new(@session)
```

### Spotify Connect

With [Spotify Connect], you can take your music experience anywhere on over 300 devices. And you can read and control most devices programmatically through the SDK:

#### Read your devices\*

```ruby
@sdk.connect.devices # => [#<Spotify::SDK::Connect::Device:...>, ...]

@sdk.connect.devices[0].active?
@sdk.connect.devices[0].private_session?
@sdk.connect.devices[0].volume
@sdk.connect.devices[0].restricted?
```

#### Read current playback\*

```ruby
@sdk.connect.playback
@sdk.connect.playback.playing? # => true
@sdk.connect.playback.device.private_session? # => false
@sdk.connect.playback.shuffling? # => false
@sdk.connect.playback.repeat_mode # => :context
@sdk.connect.playback.position_percentage # => 4.53
@sdk.connect.playback.artist.name # => "Ed Sheeran"
@sdk.connect.playback.item.album.name # => "÷"
```

#### Control playback\*

```ruby
@sdk.connect.devices[0].play!({
  uri: "spotify:track:0tgVpDi06FyKpA1z0VMD4v"
})

@sdk.connect.devices[0].pause!
@sdk.connect.devices[0].resume!
@sdk.connect.devices[0].volume = 80
@sdk.connect.devices[0].previous!
@sdk.connect.devices[0].next!
@sdk.connect.devices[0].position_ms = 3_000
@sdk.connect.devices[0].shuffle = false
@sdk.connect.devices[0].repeat_mode = :context
```
