# Introduction

We're building a SDK to programmatically interact with [Spotify] using Ruby. It focuses on being as familiar and native to Ruby developers, from hobbyists to experts, and allowing them to be creative with music technology.

Even more importantly, we're focusing on building software that isn't just expected to be abandoned; but rather help to experiment and define better standards for consistently maintained community software.

[Read more about the standards we're aiming to achieve on GitHub](https://github.com/bih/spotify-ruby#introduction).

# Objectives

As mentioned in our `README.md`, we have four objectives with this SDK:

1.  **üßí Thoughtfully inclusive for beginners.** Everything we do should think about beginners from the start. From having an enforced [Code of Conduct] policy to building great documentation, tooling, and an empathetic feedback process. Designing for beginners is designing for longevity.

1.  **‚òÅÔ∏è Agnostic to minor changes.** APIs change all the time. We should be opinionated enough that our software should break with major changes, but flexible enough to work perfectly fine with minor changes. Our code should only depend on critical data, such as IDs.

1.  **üåà Delightful for developers.** Writing the SDK and using the SDK should be equally delightful. Granted, this is a challenging goal; but with solid information architecture, well-crafted opinions, clear and helpful error messages, and software that doesn't get in your way - we will create quite lovely software.

1.  **‚ú® A maintained production-level.** It doesn't take experts to write production-level code; all it takes is considerate guidance from the community. We should write software that we and others [trust to do what it is intended to do](https://hackernoon.com/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5). We care about [Semantic Versioning] for clear version changes.

# Getting Started

There's multiple ways you can contribute, and we'll cover all of them:

- [Website](#website)
  - [Setting up Jekyll](#setting-up-jekyll)
  - [Folder Structure](#folder-structure)
- [SDK](#sdk)
  - [Versioning](#versioning)
  - [Configuration](#configuration)
  - [SDK Folder Structure](#sdk-folder-structure)
  - [Adding a Component](#adding-a-component)
  - [Adding a Model](#adding-a-model)
  - [Testing](#testing)

## Website

This refers to the website you are currently viewing. It is bundled in the `master` branch of [bih/spotify-ruby] in the `docs/` folder, even though it is not part of the source code itself. It is not compiled inside of the gem itself.

The source code is compiled using [Ruby] and [Jekyll]. It is kindly hosted for free through [GitHub Pages].

### Setting up Jekyll

You'll want to run these commands in your Terminal:

```sh
$ git clone ssh://git@github.com/bih/spotify-ruby.git
$ cd spotify-ruby/docs/
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --open-url
```

The last command creates a local server and reloads whenever you make changes. Don't forget that if you edit the `_config.yml` you will need to restart the server by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> and then re-running the last command.

More information and troubleshooting can be found in Jekyll's [Installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) guide.

### Folder Structure

In the `docs/` folder, see all the respective content:

| Type       | Description           | Location                       |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| [Markdown] | Website Documentation | [docs/assets]/\*\*/\*          |
| Images     | Content Assets        | [docs/assets]/\*\*/\*          |
| Images     | Layout Assets         | [docs/theme/assets]/\*\*/\*    |

| HTML       | HTML Components       | [docs/theme/_includes]/\*.html |
| HTML       | HTML Layouts          | [docs/theme/_layouts]/\*.html  |

## SDK

This covers all of the code in `spotify-ruby`, excluding the `docs/` folder (which was covered in [Website](#website) above).

### Versioning

We follow the [Semantic Versioning] convention in our versioning. Here's a excerpt that will explain the convention better:

```md
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
```

As a general rule of thumb, we always preference backwards compatibility as much as possible. It helps us achieve our [üåà Delightful for Developers](https://github.com/bih/spotify-ruby#introduction) objective for this SDK.

### Configuration

In our project, we have the core files in the root folder `/`:

### SDK Folder Structure

In the `lib/spotify/` and `spec/` folders, we have a specific folder structure that we'll explain:

#### lib/spotify/

| Type   | File                  | Description                                                                             |
| ------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Ruby] | [version.rb]          | Stores the `Spotify::VERSION` constant. See [Versioning](#versioning) for more details. |
| [Ruby] | [accounts.rb]         | The source file for `Spotify::Accounts` and authenticating with the SDK.                |
| [Ruby] | [accounts/session.rb] | &#x21B3; A subclass of `Spotify::Accounts` that deals with session management.          |
| [Ruby] | [sdk.rb]              | The source file for `Spotify::SDK` and interfacing with the Spotify Platform.           |
| [Ruby] | [sdk/base.rb]         | &#x21B3; The core class for creating a [SDK Component](#adding-a-component).            |
| [Ruby] | [sdk/model.rb]        | &#x21B3; The core class for creating a [SDK Model](#adding-a-model).                    |

All other files in `lib/spotify/sdk/` are either [components](#adding-a-component) or [models](#adding-a-model). It is possible to identify what type of object they are by seeing where they inherit from.

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

module Spotify
  class SDK
    class Me < Base # This is a component.
    end

    class User < Model # This is a model.
    end
  end
end
```

#### spec/

| Type     | File                | Description                                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Ruby]   | [spec_helper.rb]    | The core Ruby file which configures our [RSpec], [WebMock] and testing environment.          |
| Mocks    | [factories.rb]      | The source of truth for generating "mock" Ruby objects for the SDK. Powered by [FactoryBot]. |
| Fixtures | [support/fixtures/] | The folder containing sample [Spotify] API responses to be used with [WebMock].              |

All files in the `spec/` with the `*_spec.rb` filename are [RSpec] tests. They depend on [WebMock] for mocking API responses and [FactoryBot] for mocking Ruby objects.

To see a full list of all [RSpec] tests, run this in your Terminal:

```sh
$ ls -l spec/**/*_spec.rb
```

[spec_helper.rb]: https://github.com/bih/spotify-ruby/blob/master/spec/spec_helper.rb
[factories.rb]: https://github.com/bih/spotify-ruby/blob/master/spec/factories.rb
[support/fixtures/]: https://github.com/bih/spotify-ruby/blob/master/spec/support/fixtures/

### Adding a Component

Components are subclasses of `Spotify::SDK` and typically represent a category of features for the [Spotify Platform]. For example, `Connect` represents a category of features - listing devices, controlling them, reading current playback, etc. Another example would be `Me` - listing my information, my top tracks, my saved tracks, etc.

In the `bin/` folder, we have provided a Rails-like generator that will generate the relevant files for you to add a new component:

#### Generating Component

For example, if you'd like to generate a component called `Friends` run the following command:

```sh
$ bin/generate_component friends
```

It will then generate the following files for you:

```sh
$ cat lib/spotify/sdk/friends.rb
$ cat spec/lib/spotify/sdk/friends_spec.rb
```

#### Mounting Component

Then you'll need to do two manual steps in `lib/spotify/sdk.rb`:

- Include the component at the top:

  ```ruby
  # Components
  require "spotify/sdk/friends"
  ```

- Then mount the component as `friends` in `Spotify::SDK::SDK_COMPONENTS`:
  ```ruby
  SDK_COMPONENTS = {
    ...,
    friends: Spotify::SDK::Friends
  }.freeze
  ```

That's it! We have setup a component. You can go ahead and write some fun logic! üôÇ

#### Writing Component Logic

In our component, we can create a method called `hi`:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

module Spotify
  class SDK
    class Friend < Base
      ##
      # Hello world!
      #
      # @see https://bih.github.io/spotify-ruby/documentation/contributing/
      #
      # @param [Class] param_name Description
      # @return [String] text Description
      #
      def hi
        "Hello world!"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

The comments above are used by [YARD] to generate our [SDK Reference] on <https://rubydoc.info>.

#### Debugging Component Logic

As we've mounted our component as `friends` already, we can use the following code to test it in our console by running `bin/console`:

```sh
$ bin/console
[1] pry(main)> @accounts = Spotify::Accounts.new(client_id: "[client id]", client_secret: "[client secret]", redirect_uri: "[redirect_uri]")
=> #<Spotify::Accounts:0x007fb1ac8fba28>
[2] pry(main)> @session = Spotify::Accounts::Session.from_refresh_token(@accounts, "[refresh token]")
=> #<Spotify::Accounts::Session:0x007fb1ac8d9360>
[3] pry(main)> @sdk = Spotify::SDK.new(@session)
=> #<Spotify::SDK:0x007fb1abbafd10>
[4] pry(main)> @sdk.friends
=> #<Spotify::SDK::Friends:0x007fd7d31784e8>
[5] pry(main)> @sdk.friends.hi
=> "Hello world"
```

#### Testing Component Logic

In our generated `spec/lib/spotify/sdk/friends_spec.rb` file, we can write some [RSpec] tests:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

require "spec_helper"

RSpec.describe Spotify::SDK::Friends do
  let(:session) { build(:session, access_token: "access_token") }
  subject { Spotify::SDK.new(session).friends }

  describe "#hi" do
    it "returns 'Hello world'" do
      expect(subject.hi).to eq "Hello world"
    end
  end
end
```

And then you can execute tests by running `rake ci` in the root directory.

#### Sample Component Implementation

For an example of a good implementation, see the following files for `Spotify::SDK::Me` component:

- Implementation: [lib/spotify/sdk/me.rb]
- RSpec Tests: [spec/lib/spotify/sdk/me_spec.rb]
- Fixture: [spec/support/fixtures/get/v1/me/object.json]

[lib/spotify/sdk/me.rb]: https://github.com/bih/spotify-ruby/blob/master/lib/spotify/sdk/me.rb
[spec/lib/spotify/sdk/me_spec.rb]: https://github.com/bih/spotify-ruby/blob/master/spec/lib/spotify/sdk/me_spec.rb
[spec/support/fixtures/get/v1/me/object.json]: https://github.com/bih/spotify-ruby/blob/master/spec/support/fixtures/get/v1/me/object.json

### Adding a Model

Models are typically classes that hold data. They often contain functions to manipulate or perform actions with that data. An example is a `Device` model, it would contain a method like `pause!` which will take the `id` and send a `PUT /v1/me/player/pause?device_id={id}` HTTP command.

**Protip:** The models we write use Ruby's [OpenStruct] data structure; it is designed for flexible Hash objects. It fits in our [second objective](#objectives) of "being agnostic to minor changes"; in cases where Spotify may return `null` or contain additional fields, our codebase will not break.

In our `bin/` folder, similarly to components, we have a Rails-like generator that will generate the relevant files for you to add a new model:

#### Generating Model

For example, if you'd like to generate a model called `Device` run the following command:

```sh
$ bin/generate_model device
```

It will then generate the following files for you:

```sh
$ cat lib/spotify/sdk/device.rb
$ cat spec/lib/spotify/sdk/device_spec.rb
$ cat spec/factories/device.rb
```

#### Mounting a Model

Then you'll need to do one step in `lib/spotify/sdk.rb`:

- Include the model at the top:
  ```ruby
  # Models
  require "spotify/sdk/device"
  ```

#### Writing Model Logic

In our model, we can create a method called `pause!`:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

module Spotify
  class SDK
    class Device < Model
      ##
      # Pause this device.
      #
      # @see https://bih.github.io/spotify-ruby/documentation/contributing/
      #
      # @param [Class] param_name Description
      # @return [String] text Description
      #
      def pause!
        parent.send_http_request(:put, "/v1/me/player/play?device_id=#{id}", {
          http_options: {
            expect_nil: true # This API returns a blank response. This is OK.
          }
        })
        self # Let's return itself, so we can support chaining methods.
      end
    end
  end
end
```

And then we can initialize the SDK with two parameters:

- A `Hash` payload. For example `{ device_id: "id of device here" }`
- An instance of a valid Component (see Friends above)

You can see an example in [Debugging Model Logic](#debugging-model-logic) below.

#### Debugging Model Logic

With our new `Spotify::SDK::Device` model, we can now run this in `bin/console`:

```sh
$ bin/console
[1] pry(main)> @accounts = Spotify::Accounts.new(client_id: "[client id]", client_secret: "[client secret]", redirect_uri: "[redirect_uri]")
=> #<Spotify::Accounts:0x007fb1ac8fba28>
[2] pry(main)> @session = Spotify::Accounts::Session.from_refresh_token(@accounts, "[refresh token]")
=> #<Spotify::Accounts::Session:0x007fb1ac8d9360>
[3] pry(main)> @sdk = Spotify::SDK.new(@session)
=> #<Spotify::SDK:0x007fb1abbafd10>
[4] pry(main)> @base = Spotify::SDK::Base.new(@sdk)
=> #<Spotify::SDK::Base:0x007fb1ac11dd10>
[5] pry(main)> @device = Spotify::SDK::Device.new({ id: 1234, is_active: true, is_private_session: false, is_restricted: false, name: "Device Name", type: "Smartphone", volume_percent: 24 }, @base)
=> #<Spotify::SDK::Connect::Device id=1234, is_active=true, is_private_session=false, is_restricted=false, name="Device Name", type="Smartphone", volume_percent=24>
[6] pry(main)> @device.pause!
=> #<Spotify::SDK::Connect::Device id=1234, is_active=true, is_private_session=false, is_restricted=false, name="Device Name", type="Smartphone", volume_percent=24>
```

#### Testing Model Logic

For models, we have a slightly different approach to testing them. As they handle API response data from [Spotify], we would need to mock what those responses look like to ensure the SDK is able to respond in the way we expect it to.

Usually we'd need to add the following:

- Mock Ruby model object: [FactoryBot]

  - Typically adding this Ruby code to `spec/factories.rb`:

    ```ruby
    factory :device, class: Spotify::SDK::Device do
      association :parent, factory: :base

      skip_create
      initialize_with { new(attributes, parent) }
    end
    ```

- Mock API response: [Fixtures](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12071344/what-are-fixtures-in-programming)
  - Typically adding the expected JSON response for the model in `spec/support/fixtures/` with the criteria:
  - Filename format convention: `spec/support/fixtures/{method_type}/{version}/{endpoint}/{custom_name}.json`
  - Example: `spec/support/fixtures/v1/get/me/player/devices/active-list.json`

And then similarly to Components, we'll need to add tests for the `Spotify::SDK::Device` object we created in `spec/lib/spotify/sdk/device_spec.rb`

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

require "spec_helper"

RSpec.describe Spotify::SDK::Device do
  let(:raw_data) { read_fixture("get/v1/me/player/devices/active-list") }
  let(:session)  { build(:session, access_token: "access_token") }
  let(:sdk_base) { Spotify::SDK::Base.new(Spotify::SDK.new(session)) }
  subject        { Spotify::SDK::Device.new(raw_data, sdk_base) }

  describe "#to_h" do
    it "returns the correct value" do
      expect(subject.to_h).to eq raw_data
    end
  end

  describe "#pause!" do
    it "should make an api call" do
      stub = stub_request(:put, "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/pause?device_id=#{raw_data[:id]}")
             .with(headers: {Authorization: "Bearer access_token"})

      subject.pause!
      expect(stub).to have_been_requested
    end

    it "should return itself" do
      expect(subject.pause!).to be subject
    end
  end
end
```

And you can run all of the tests by running `rake ci` in the root directory.

#### Sample Model Implementation

For an example of a good implementation, see the following files for `Spotify::SDK::Connect::Device` model:

- Implementation: [lib/spotify/sdk/connect/device.rb]
- RSpec Tests: [spec/lib/spotify/sdk/connect/device_spec.rb]
- Ruby Object Mock: [spec/factories.rb]
- Spotify API Response Mocks / Fixtures:

- If the change is with `docs/`, once merged [GitHub Pages] will automatically deploy your changes to [bih.github.io/spotify-ruby]. It can sometimes take up to 15 minutes to propagate.
- If the change is with the SDK, we will publish the changes in the next MAJOR/MINOR release. Urgent changes will result in an expedited PATCH release, as per the [Semantic Versioning] convention.

If we have reviewed it, we will most likely suggest changes for you. The feedback will need to be addressed by you or another community member. We may close PRs that may be inactive, unclear, or controversial.

## Add Your Profile as a Contributor

If you're contributing changes to any file in `docs/documentation/`, it is possible to mention yourself as an official contributor!

It's possible to see at the top of this page, or in the screenshot below:
![](/documentation/contributing/edit.png)

To add yourself, in the relevant `.md` file, at the top you should see:

```yaml
contributors:
  - https://github.com/bih
```

All you need to do is to create a new line with your GitHub username:

```yaml
contributors:
  - https://github.com/bih
  - https://github.com/[your github username here]
```

That's all - we'll use your public GitHub avatar and give you some üíñ!
