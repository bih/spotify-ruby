module Spotify
  ##
  # The definitive version of spotify-ruby.
  #
  # You'll need to bump this for every change. The
  # rule of thumb is to update it by one minor version (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)
  # if there is no breaking changes or new features. Anything
  # else should constitute a major version bump (0.1.0 -> 1.0.0)
  #
  VERSION = "0.2.1"
